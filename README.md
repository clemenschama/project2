# project2
name: Clemens Tombozi Chama
this project was motivated by the love my friends have for soccer. since i am not a soccer fan myself, i figured i'd learn a few facts about it is so i could be part of the conversation whenever it came up. the project shows the stats of how may shots were made by each premiure league team over a year. it also shows the number of referees who officiated each game as well as how many times they did it. i love knowledge and problem solving so this was fun for me.
